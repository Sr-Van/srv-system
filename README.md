# Srv Internet Admin System

## Open code.
## My idea is to practice. with this internet provider system, test some frameworks, improve my basics in HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. Improve my knowledge mainly in array.
## Focused in Front-end.

- For the searching i used Lodash. And to lower the size of the app i used document.fragment when rendering searched clients. 
- For the charts I used CSS and make it responsive as good i could.

### How to Test:
> for login use: ``admin@admin.com``
> for password use: ``admin1234``

### on the dashboard:
> You have to add a client on *cadastros* then the dashboard will load.

You can Search for Name, CPF and addres. 


## Sessions:
**Dashboard**: first card its all time registered clients and active clients. You **can** delete atcive register but you **cant** delete all time registered.
the second card is the amout of money you have to received based on the clients payments opened (when you add a register the app automaticly create payments to the day the client choose and till month 12, also do the math so de client will only pay what he uses) and the amout of payments that already get paid.
the third card is orders of service opened when you register a client, or when a client contact you for something and the total amount of orders.
the fourth is a feedback output, also in orders you can add a feedback order, about anything and you have to choose the situation to *good* or *bad* so it will show on the dashboard.

**Registers**: there y'll find a table with all the registers, if you click in the name of the client you can change a few things on his register.

**Bills**: there you can find another table but with others informations, and you have a button where you can confirm the payment of any month that has been created.

**Orders**: There you will see a table with the orders, a graphic with done and not done orders and a output to see the message that is in the order. in the table you have a icon where you can click to edit de order to ended our another situation that changed,
for show the message on the output you also has to click on the edit icon.

## Código aberto.
## Minha ideia é praticar. com esse sistema de provedor de internet testar algumas frameworks, melhorar meu basico em HTML, CSS3 E Javascript. Melhorar meu conhecimento principalmente em array.
## Focado em Front-end mas com bastante back pra que funcione. Esse é meu objetivo final.

- Pra fazer o código da pesquisa usei a framework Lodash
- Para os graficos vou usar circulos em svg apenas de forma ilustrativa, prefiro usar chartJS e tenho um bom conhecimento da framework.
